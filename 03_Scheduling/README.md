# 📆 TN-S41B · Scheduling Overview

## 🚧 Build Logic: Run It Like Commercial

This is not a residential pace. TN-S41B will operate like a **light commercial jobsite** — with intelligent sequencing, overlapping trade crews, and *simultaneous interior + exterior* work to drive efficiency and hit schedule.

We are not building *slowly* — we are building *systematically*. All stakeholders, subcontractors, and site managers are expected to work within this upgraded rhythm.

## 🔁 Overlapping Trade Logic

Unlike traditional residential rehabs where trades move linearly (one crew finishes, the next starts), TN-S41B is structured for **overlap**.

| Phase | Trades Active Simultaneously |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| **Demo / Framing** | Demolition, Framing, Layout Markup, Initial MEP Planning |
| **Rough-Ins** | Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Site Drainage (Ext.) |
| **Substrate / Systems Close** | Inspections, Insulation, Subfloor, Backer Board, Exterior Siding |
| **Finishes** | Drywall, Paint, Trim, Cabinetry, Exterior Paint |
| **Finals** | Fixtures, Hardware, Punch, Exterior Touchups, Cleaning |

> ⚠️ **Coordination is critical**. Trade leads must be willing to adjust daily to real-time site conditions.

## 🏠 Interior + Exterior = Parallel Tracks

Interior and exterior work will run **in parallel**, not sequentially. That means:

- **Exterior siding, power-washing, or drainage** may begin while **interior drywall or floor installs** are underway.
- There will be **multiple crews on-site** on peak days — this is expected, not a scheduling error.
- Parking, debris removal, staging areas, and cleanup must be proactively managed.

---

## 💡 Schedule Ethos

We are operating under a **tight and deliberate schedule** based on commercial project discipline:

- **Weekends are workdays** unless otherwise agreed.
- **Daily cleanup is mandatory** — no trade leaves mess for the next.
- **Subcontractor handoffs** are not passive — each trade is expected to coordinate directly with the one before and after.
- **No idle time** — delays must be communicated immediately and solved before they cascade.

---

## 🔑 Key Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Site Manager / Owner Rep** | Enforces daily work rhythm, handles material delivery, unlocks problem areas. |
| **Lead Subcontractor (per trade)** | Coordinates crew timing, ensures daily progress, and confirms completed work before exit. |
| **Project Scheduler / PM** | Adjusts macro schedule and communicates updates to the field. |

## 📌 Expectations

- Treat this like a commercial schedule — every day without movement is a cost.
- If you don’t know what’s next: ask.
- If a material is missing: call immediately.
- If you’re waiting on another trade: coordinate, don’t wait passively.
- Respect the system, or you’ll fall behind it.

> 🧠 ** Designed once, to last decades. Let’s build like it.
