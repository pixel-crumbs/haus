# 🧰 TN-S41B · Subcontractor Scopes Overview

## 🔧 Subcontractor Strategy

Every subcontractor on TN-S41B is part of an integrated, **commercial-level build system**. This is not a scattered series of residential jobs — this is **intelligent construction**, paced aggressively and documented thoroughly.

You are not here to “wing it.”  
You are here to **execute with excellence**, guided by a room-by-room Scope of Work (SOW), with clear expectations, sequencing, and communication.

## 📦 Labor-Only Model

We are operating under a **labor-only** arrangement:

- All **materials are owner-supplied** and will be staged on-site.
- If a material is missing, **alert the Project Manager** — do not substitute or install alternates.
- **No markup on materials** is expected or allowed.
- You are responsible only for **installation and cleanup**, not procurement or selection.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each trade has a dedicated `.md` file in this directory. These include:

- 🧱 `Drywall.md`
- 🔌 `Electrical.md`
- 🚰 `Plumbing.md`
- 🛁 `Tile_and_Microcement.md`
- 🌬️ `HVAC.md`
- 🌳 `Landscaping.md`
- 🪟 `Windows.md`
- 🔨 `Framing.md` *(if separated from GC)*
- 🎨 `Paint.md` *(optional based on GC package)*

Each file includes:

- ✅ Trade-specific responsibilities
- 🛠 Material handling rules
- 🧭 Sequence and coordination notes
- 🧼 Clean-up and handoff expectations
- 🔗 Links to related room-level SOWs

## 📆 Trade Handoff Coordination

This project is sequenced with **tight overlaps** between trades. Subcontractors must:

- Be **available on-call** for inspection corrections or emergency rework.
- **Coordinate directly** with trades ahead and behind them.
- **Walk the jobsite** before first day of work — no cold starts.

## 🔒 Non-Negotiables

1. **No substitutions.** Install only the provided materials.
2. **No ghosting.** If you’re running late or rescheduling, tell us. We plan around your scope.
3. **No shortcuts.** Cut corners, and you won’t be invited back.
4. **Daily cleanup is mandatory.** Leave the site better than you found it.
5. **Document your work.** Take photos, tag issues, and verify close-out.

## 🤝 We Work With Builders, Not Just Installers

We’re building something bigger than a house — we’re building **trust-based infrastructure**. You’re not just swinging a hammer or gluing tile. You’re **helping shape a system** that runs better than 99% of the industry.

> "Work clean. Move with intention. Be the trade that raises the standard."

Let’s build it right — the first time.
