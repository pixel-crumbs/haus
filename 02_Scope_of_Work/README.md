# TN-S41B · Master System Scope of Work

---

## 1. Project Summary

**Project Title**: TN-S41B  
**Type**: Full Gut Rehab  
**Goal**: Transform existing single-family structure into two self-contained rental units (Level 1 & Level 2) with independent kitchens, baths, and laundry. All systems will be stripped to framing and rebuilt with longevity, code compliance, and property value appreciation in mind.

---

## 2. Global Assumptions

- **Full Gut**: Property will be stripped to framing throughout.
- **Longevity Target**: Rehab is designed to last 30+ years for hold strategy.
- **New Systems**: Entirely new electrical and plumbing throughout. HVAC receives full professional maintenance; system is <10 years old.
- **Dual Units**: Level 1 (Basement) and Level 2 (Main) will each have:
  - Full kitchen
  - Private bedrooms
  - Private bathrooms (including en suites)
  - Laundry room (Level 2 laundry was previously missed—now included)
- **Material Ownership**: All materials will be purchased and supplied by ownership. Labor-only bidding applies.
- **Finish Standard**: Best industry practices for the 37218 area. Durable, cleanable, rental-friendly, and value-adding.
- **Shower/Bath Finish**: Use **micro-cement** wall finishes (luxury look, low cost).  
  - Tile floors only (preferably large format). Avoid tiling walls.
