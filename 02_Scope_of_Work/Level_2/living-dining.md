#### üõ† Special Notes
- Opening should be **wide enough for light + line-of-sight**, but **retain wall definition** to separate kitchen from formal entry path.
- Edge treatment should be elegant (bullnose, trimmed box, or cased archway optional).
- Use symmetrical ceiling lighting to anchor the living and dining zones distinctly.
- Entry flooring and kitchen flooring should match to unify zones visually.
