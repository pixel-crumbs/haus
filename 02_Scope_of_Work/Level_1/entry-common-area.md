- If feasible, consider:
  - Push-to-open magnetic latch
  - Full-height flush slab door with paint-matched finish
  - Faux millwork (e.g. panel or bookcase motif) for added concealment
- Door must remain operable from both sides; no deadbolts unless egress compliance allows.
- Entry lighting should feel welcoming but discreet ‚Äî motion sensor optional.
