## 🧠 99/1 System Philosophy

**Your 1% was providing the intelligence source.**  
This repository delivers the 99% — systems that think, schedule, protect, and automate like you would — if you had the time.

- **Intelligent Contractor Protection** (Stage 3 Legal Kernel)
- **Hyper-Efficient Scheduling** (FlipperForce + Humanficial)
- **Scope Down to the Studs** (Stage 2)
- **Remote Execution-Ready Systems** (Draw/Inspection triggers, AI oversight, smart contracts)

---

## ✅ Usage Instructions

- Start at `01_Project_Overview/` to get grounded.
- Use `02_Scope_of_Work/` and `03_Scheduling/` to scope, track, and monitor.
- Distribute `04_Contractor_Pack/` to GCs and subs to begin bidding.
- Plug in automation logic from `07_Automations/` if integrating with HIOS ops stack.
- Everything is designed to operate **with or without you**. That’s the point.

## 👁️ Final Note

This project is **not** a construction file.  
It’s a **system architecture** that makes real estate intelligent.  
Welcome to Humanficial Design™.
